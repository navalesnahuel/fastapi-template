3. Run the Application

### Development Guide

- Run the application in development mode with `just dev`.
- Use `pytest` to execute test cases:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```
- Format and lint the code with Ruff:
  ```bash
  uv run ruff check .
  ```
- Apply Alembic migrations:
  ```bash
  uv run alembic upgrade head
  ```

---

### Deployment Guide

#### Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure you have:

- A registered domain pointing to your server
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server
- Access to your server with necessary deployment permissions

1. Build Docker Image

Build your application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker build --target production -t ${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/myapp:latest .

```

2. Push to Registry

Push the built image to your Docker registry:

```bash
docker push ${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/backend-api:latest
```

3. Configure Environment

Set up your environment variables:

    Locate the `.env` file in your project root
    Verify all required variables are present
    Update values according to your deployment environment

4. Deploy Application

Deploy using the production configuration:

```bash
just prod
```

#### Maintenance and Scaling

##### Updating the Application

To update your deployment with the latest changes:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull

# Restart containers with new image
just prod
```

##### Scaling Services

To scale your application services:

1. Modify the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file to adjust replica count:

```yaml
services:
  fastapi:
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
```

2. Apply the scaling changes:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --scale fastapi=2
```

This example scales the FastAPI service to 2 replicas.

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

### Overview

The CI/CD pipeline currently handles:
1. Testing
2. Linting
3. Building and pushing Docker images

The deployment step has been removed from the default pipeline since deployment targets vary by user. This guide will help you configure your own deployment step.

### Current Pipeline Structure

```yaml
jobs:
  test:    # Runs tests with PostgreSQL service
  lint:    # Checks code quality
  build:   # Builds and pushes Docker image
```

### Adding Your Deployment Step

To add deployment to your infrastructure, create a new job after the build step. Here's a template you can modify:

```yaml
  deploy:
    needs: [build]
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2

      # Add your deployment steps here
```

### Testing Your Deployment

1. Add your deployment configuration to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
2. Set up required secrets in your GitHub repository
3. Push to main branch to trigger the pipeline
4. Monitor the Actions tab for deployment status
