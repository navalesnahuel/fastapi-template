Metrics:
    Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection.
    Use FastAPI middleware like prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator.


Docker Security:
    Run containers as non-root users
    Scan images for vulnerabilities with Trivy or Docker Scout.
API Security:
    Enable CORS, rate limiting, and input validation in FastAPI.
CI/CD Pipeline
    Automate Testing & Deployment:
        Use GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to:
            Run tests on PRs.
            Build and push images to Docker Hub/ECR.
            Deploy to staging/prod environments (e.g., AWS ECS, Kubernetes).

Secrets Environment variables


Documentation
    API Docs: FastAPI auto-generates Swagger/OpenAPI docs at /docs – ensure they’re accessible.
    Deployment Guide:
        Write a DEPLOY.md explaining:
            How to run docker-compose up.
            Environment variables required.
            Disaster recovery steps.


Backup & Disaster Recovery
    Database Backups:
        Schedule daily backups (e.g., using pg_dump for PostgreSQL).
    Rollback Strategy:
        Use tagged Docker images (e.g., v1.2.3) to revert easily.


Stateless Design:
    Ensure your app is stateless (store sessions in Redis or databases).

Final Checklist
    Test end-to-end in a staging environment.
    Perform load testing (use tools like Locust).
    Secure all endpoints with authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
    Validate backups and rollback procedures.
