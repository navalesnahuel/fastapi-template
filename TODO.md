Secrets Management for both production and development
    Use Docker Secrets or a tool like Vault for sensitive data (never hardcode secrets).
    For local development, use .env files with docker-compose.env_file.


Logging & Monitoring
    Structured Logging:
        Configure JSON logging in FastAPI for tools like ELK or Datadog.
    Health Checks:
        Add a /health endpoint to monitor app status.
        Configure Docker healthchecks
    Metrics:
        Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection.
        Use FastAPI middleware like prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator.


Security Hardening
    Reverse Proxy & SSL:
        Add Nginx or Traefik in front of FastAPI for SSL termination, rate limiting, and compression.
        Use Let’s Encrypt for free certificates.
    Docker Security:
        Run containers as non-root users
        Scan images for vulnerabilities with Trivy or Docker Scout.
    API Security:
        Enable CORS, rate limiting, and input validation in FastAPI.
CI/CD Pipeline
    Automate Testing & Deployment:
        Use GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to:
            Run tests on PRs.
            Build and push images to Docker Hub/ECR.
            Deploy to staging/prod environments (e.g., AWS ECS, Kubernetes).


Documentation
    API Docs: FastAPI auto-generates Swagger/OpenAPI docs at /docs – ensure they’re accessible.
    Deployment Guide:
        Write a DEPLOY.md explaining:
            How to run docker-compose up.
            Environment variables required.
            Disaster recovery steps.


Backup & Disaster Recovery
    Database Backups:
        Schedule daily backups (e.g., using pg_dump for PostgreSQL).
    Rollback Strategy:
        Use tagged Docker images (e.g., v1.2.3) to revert easily.


Scaling & Orchestration
    Production Orchestration:
        Use Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE) or docker-compose for small setups.
    Stateless Design:
        Ensure your app is stateless (store sessions in Redis or databases).


Final Checklist
    Test end-to-end in a staging environment.
    Perform load testing (use tools like Locust).
    Secure all endpoints with authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
    Validate backups and rollback procedures.
