# Ideas for my FastAPI Template

Environment Configuration

    PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy:
        Use async SQLAlchemy engine for asynchronous operations.
        Pessimistic connection pooling configuration for optimized database access and management.
        Migrations organized in an easy-to-sort format: YYYY-MM-DD_slug.
        Ensure migrations are formatted with Ruff for consistent code style.

Global Pydantic Model

    Include explicit timezone setting during JSON export to avoid ambiguity with date and time fields.

Production Configurations

    Gunicorn:
        Use dynamic worker configuration (borrowed from @tiangolo) for efficient worker management.
    Dockerfile:
        Optimized for smaller size and faster builds, incorporating a non-root user for security and best practices.
    Logging:
        Use JSON logs for easy parsing and integration with log management tools.
    Sentry:
        Set up Sentry integration for error tracking and monitoring in deployed environments.

Additional Features

    Global Exception Handling:
        Define and use global exception handlers to manage errors across the app consistently.
    SQLAlchemy Naming Convention:
        Apply SQLAlchemy keys naming conventions to keep naming consistent and readable.
    Alembic Shortcuts:
        Provide shortcut scripts for Alembic commands to streamline migration workflows.

ORM Options

    SQLAlchemy (Async):
        Default ORM using SQLAlchemy (Async) for asynchronous database operations.
    Optional ORMs:
        Consider adding SQLModel as an alternative ORM for users who prefer it.
        Provide flexibility for users to choose other ORMs if needed.
    Supabase Authentication:
        Integrate Supabase for authentication with SQLAlchemy for seamless database interaction.
        Include JWT tokens for secure user authentication.

Testing Setup

    Pytest with Async Support:
        Set up pytest for asynchronous testing using Async test fixtures to ensure reliable and scalable testing.

CI/CD Pipeline

    Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment of your FastAPI app.

Optional:

    AtlasGo for Migrations:
        Consider using AtlasGo for efficient database migrations and schema management.
